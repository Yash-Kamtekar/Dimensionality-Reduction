**Dimensionality Reduction conclusion for Tabular Dataset**

For the tabular dataset, we could observe from the plotted graphs of all dimensionality reduction techniques that PCA had well-formed clusters for all the target class values which will help in building an ML model with better accuracy.


**Dimensionality Reduction Conclusion for Image Dataset

As there are many unique target class values in the image dataset the clusters of points are scattered very close to each other and only few are overlapped for all the dimensionality reduction techniques except for LLE. Hence we can conclude that LLE cannot be opted as the best dimensionality reduction technique for this dataset as many points for each target attribute value are overlapped.
